# Sample
This folder contains a series of scripts I have made in various languages to give an overview of some of the work I do.
They cover topics ranging from random forests, based on decision trees, to python scripts that demonstrate the use of industrial grade optimization software.
Overall, they are intended to highlight my technical proficiency in SQL, Python, and R.
