# Sample
This folder contains a series of scripts I have made in various languages to give an overview of some of the work I do.
In picking these I had to choose from a broad range, so one or two are selected from various domains.
They're sorted in roughly alphabetical order.

Also on my github is a StrategoAI project, where I applied neural networks to the imperfect information boardgame stratego. This required generating tens of millions of board states, through self-play and those few I could get by contacting a German webmaster who ran a Stratego website, and training the AI which were most likely to lead to victory.                                                                                                             

Anyways, the samples here cover topics ranging from random forests, based on decision trees, to python scripts that demonstrate the use of industrial grade optimization software.

Overall, these were selected to highlight my technical proficiency in SQL, Python, and R.

The Stratego Project folder, another repository I have uploaded, is an ongoing project of mine to program an AI for the boardgame Stratego. 

By filename, brief descriptions of each:

BinpackingHeuristic.py: This custom binpacking heuristic is simple yet powerful, finding the optimal answer quickly.

ClusterAnalysis-Demo.xlsm: an excel workbook with heavy VBA macros that demonstrates using excel for clustering.

CustomerChurnBoosting.R: This is an R implementation of tree and forest-based methods for customer churn detection.

FeatureSubsetSelection.R: Demonstrates automated methods for selecting the best (depending on desired metrics) features, or variables, in a dataset.

FlightFinder-FormsDemo.xlsm: Shows advanced VBA form creation knowledge and general VBA useage.

ForecastModeling.R: Shows the whole analytics process in one file; data loading, data checking, checks for collinearity, does regressions, and finally time series analysis.

GurobiSample.py: Demonstrates use of the incredibly powerful Gurobi optimization software.

html_scrape.py, json_scrape.py, xml_scrape.py: These three show knowledge of methods to scrape the internet for data in several types.

twtrtextRetrievalRegex.R demonstrates something similar, grabbing tweets and then using regular expressions to parse them.

KnapsackHeuristic.py, beyond the title, this is a custom heuristic that is able to efficiently find an optimal or within 3% of optimal solution.

LinearRegression, LogisticRegression, and RegressionSplines all show their respective regression techniques.

NeuralNetworkfromScratch.py does not use any packages but strives to implement a neural net just from the base math for the network and the activation function (sigmoid). 

OptimizationSample.Rmd demonstrates use of RStudio and the Bellman-Ford optimization algorithm.

RDatabaseConnectionExample.R shows how to simply connect to a database in R. I can, perhaps obviously, also do this in python. 

Sample_Queries.sql shows some simple to advanced queries in sql.

SampleSearchFunctions.py represents python implementations of some sort algorithms, such as linear and bisection.

SeasonalDecomposition.R is another time series example for detecting seasonality

SolverDemos.xlsx shows examples of various ways of using excel's solver to find optimal solutions to things ranging from machine scheduling to shipping cost minimization and beyond.

SupportVectorMachines.R goes through this technology and its implementation.
